# CRUD - Create WebService.
Hello, I'm Edgardo Vaca, this is a crud using Visual Basic .Net, below I will give you the instructions so that the program works correctly for you:

- You need to have Visual Studio 2019 and Sql Server Managament Studio 2018.
- Fork all the files of (<a href="https://github.com/edgvac22/Crud-College-Create-WS">Crud-College-Create-WS</a>) and put it in a folder, and the files of (<a href="https://github.com/edgvac22/Crud-College-Consume-WS">Crud-College-Consume-WS</a>), and put it in a folder too.
- Import the database in your Sql Server (UTP_Panama_Backup).
- Open the proyect in Visual Studio 2019.
- Change the configurations in "Capa_Datos" BD.vb for your Sql configurations, where is the connectionstring.

Also, is important when you login in your Sql Server, join with SQL Server Authentication and not with Windows Authentication.
